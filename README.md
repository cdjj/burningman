##  Context

This document was started many moons ago by Alex Gorbatchev. It was released originally as a Google doc, with many people commenting on it. At some point it felt it had been abandoned, so I (Jesus Climent) created a working copy to continue his work. At this point so many people have contributed to this guide that "I" and "me" no longer refer to Alex Gorbatchev (who started this guide) or any other person in particular, but to the collective hive mind. However,

##  Introduction

This document is meant as a starting point for everyone who is coming to Burning Man for the first time (or second, third, etc). It includes most of the information you need to prepare for the practical parts of your burn, with examples and (hopefully) updated links to some of the products we discuss.

There are other non-practical considerations that you want to know about because they affect your preparation, like the [10 ~~commandments~~ principles](https://burningman.org/about/10-principles/). These principles will shape the way you go about and will have an impact on your day-to-day burn experience. For example, the second principle (Gifting) means that you will not be able to buy or sell anything (except ice) inside Black Rock City. Also means that you don't have to pay cover to enter establishments, or when you get a drink. But it also means you cannot walk to the nearest pharmacy if you need some toiletries (and therefore you should bring with you everything you may think you are going to need when you are there!!).

First and foremost, before your start with this guide, **especially if this is your first year**, read the official [Survival Guide](https://survival.burningman.org/) and check out the event page.

Second, no, really, read the official [Survival Guide](https://survival.burningman.org/).

Third, take most advice related to Burning Man, **including this guide**, with a grain of salt (and a sprinkle of dust). What works for some people may not work for you, so it is a game of experimentation and failure, and sometimes success.


## General considerations

Burning Man happens in the Black Rock desert, a hostile environment. It can be cold at night, sometimes below freezing, and it can be hot during the day, sometimes reaching temperatures much higher than the human body (2018 recorded 43c/110f, and someone swears it was up to 48c/119f; 2022 was a very, very, VERY HOT WEEK, and some veterans claim it was [the worst burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FcO6ijgiCY) they have been to). It can be windy as f@$k with tornado-like gusts, and calm a minute later. You may have a period of white dust and will not be able to see the end of your arm, or have crystal-clear air. It may rain as it did in 2023, with the dust turning into sticky glue and your vehicle may get stranded if you are trying to move it. Or it may not. The top layer of the ground may be hard as a rock (if when it rains during the winter the evaporation happens over several weeks), or it may feel like dust (if the evaporation happened over a short period of time).

Because of all those conditions, generally speaking, you don’t want to bring your “good” pieces. The playa dust is also corrosive (alkali in nature) and extremely fine. It will end up in curious places, and in many cases, once there, it will stay forever. And there's a good chance that you won't be able to fully take the dust out. I have a belt with a plastic buckle that, 6 years later, still has dust in the buckle. And has gone through the washing machine repeatedly. And my Ranger hat has a rim of yellow color from the dust that seems permanent.

That’s to say that you should avoid bringing to playa your "good" or "precious" things. Opinions vary on this, though. With enough time and dedication you can probably bring back to life any item you bring, but if dust reaches the insides of your $6000 new bike, it will be a PITA to clean it after the burn.

Burning Man is also the largest Leave No Trace (LNT) event on Planet Earth. Planning for LNT can be challenging for new folks, so [read about it ahead of time](https://burningman.org/event/preparation/leaving-no-trace/) and make sure you prepare accordingly. Removing packaging and disposing of all unnecessary wrappers ahead of time is only part of the preparation. Making sure you can collect all gray water, have enough trash bags, and enough space in your car to bring everything back is something that sometimes people forget.

==From here on this document is divided in different sections, each containing a list of entries with tips and considerations.==


## Footwear

1.  **Learn more**. Here are a few discussions on the subject of footwear ([link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1y6doh/burning_topics_week_3_omg_shoes/), [link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/r7zlj/ideal_playa_shoes/), [link 3](https://eplaya.burningman.org/viewtopic.php?t=21012))

2. **Broken in and comfortable**. Don't bring a brand new pair of shoes that you haven't worn before. There's nothing worse than breaking your shoes in with no comfortable spares.

3. **Closed toes**. Toe injuries are very common and can ruin your week very quickly. Wear them specially when you are building.

4. **Playa foot**. It's a real thing. Playa dust will mess your feet up pretty badly if left unchecked. [Please read the guide](http://burningman.org/event/preparation/health-safety/playa-foot/) on this subject; it's very important.
	>  I do get playa foot, but not everyone does. I have friends who wear flip-flops all week. You should still clean your feet every so often; a mixture of white vinegar and water is suggested to neutralize the alkali playa & wash the feet. Witch hazel works similarly and is even better cuz it doesn't smell like vinegar!

5. **Socks**. If you wear socks, thick tennis/sports socks work very well. If you don't mind spending a bit extra, merino wool socks work even better. The best playa tip I received was to bring extra fluffy (new) socks so you can change out more than once a day. Each time it feels like heaven. Keeping the new socks (and even one set of return-day clothes) in a Ziploc® baggie will ensure very happy skin.
	> I purchased some Merino wool socks from [Darn Tough](https://darntough.com/) several years ago for the burn and that was the best thing I have ever done for my feet. I use them on a regular basis, every single day, and they are still in fantastic condition.
    
6. **Insoles**. Some people bring several sets of insoles and change them over the week to be extra comfortable.
    
7. **High ankle boots**. Combined with socks, will be the most comfortable dust-free footwear. If you are going this route, bring lots of socks.
    
8. **Military surplus desert deployment boots** with socks work very well. Don't get hot, feet come out completely clean at the end of the day. The only downside is that boots are difficult to put on and take off and they might feel a little heavy. There are some models/brands that come with zippers. Use dry-lub on those zippers for easy operation.

9. **$15 sneakers without shoelaces** from Walmart with socks work very well. Feet come out mostly clean, the shoes are easy to take on and off (this will be my preferred option in the future). I bring a pair of old sneakers, one that I am ready to trash at the end of the burn, with fast laces (the ones that are elastic, like the ones used by triathletes for fast changing).
    
10. **Flip-flop / sandals / crocs**. If you have access to a shower, bring a pair. They also work for a quick trip to the portos. I personally have a deep dislike of crocs when used as day-to-day shoes, but I have a pair for the burn and they are fantastic.

11. **Footwear for rain** The rain storm and subsequent Mud Man we had in 2023 gave us some incentive for improvisation and imagination, and brought some ideas on how to deal with large amounts of water at BRC. Some materials repeal the mud better than others, like synthetic fabrics and plastic bags, so it is important to have that last layer covering your feet. Some of the different options that worked in the mud were:
    -   Contractor trash bags, covering your shoes (or your socks), tied with rope, zip ties, ... What worked for me was: sock - thin plastic bag - shoe (Keen sandals) - trash bag, all tied with zip ties.
    -   Socks covering your shoes. Surprisingly effective. I will be bringing 2 pairs of oversized socks to cover my boots, in the future.

## Clothing

1.  **It will be hot**. Prepare for the hot weather.
    
2.  **It will be cold**. In fact, it can get close to freezing at night (see [historical averages for August](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/nv/gerlach/KNVGERLA7)).
    
3.  **Have a head cover**. Have a hat, cap, or anything else that will comfortably sit and cover your head ([link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BTOP1I/)). This is especially important during the day. Anything you can wet will be even more wonderful in the heat of the day. A [boonie hat](https://www.amazon.com/Camo-Coll-Outdoor-Boonie-Summer/dp/B0725C7H4V/) with a wide brim is a good choice: it’s (1) easily available, (2) inexpensive, (3) protects against sun and eye glare, and (4) can be wetted without damage. A [shemagh](https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Shemagh-Head-Neck-Scarf/dp/B0749RFLV2/) makes a perfect companion; it can be tied over your mask, worn as a scarf, over your head for heat protection, and used for cooling by wetting it with some water.
    
4.  **Don't bring your "good" pieces**. If you do decide to bring your good stuff, here are a few tips on how you could wash it after:
	-	Mix some vinegar with water to get the playa dust off during the wash cycle.
	-	Smooth leather cleans super easily, and doesn’t get affected by the playa. I've brought my favorite everyday boots, as well as leather holsters, belts, pieces of clothing, etc for many years and the leather is unfazed. A little vinegar and water rubdown followed by leather cleaner and leather conditioner and it's as good as new. (Suede is a no-no, it will forever be playafied. Distressed leather is questionable.)
    -	You can also wash sneakers; I’ve had good results from soaking in vinegar, tossing into a washing machine, and drying.

5.  **No feathers, no sequins, and no glitter**. Don't bring anything that can fall apart into pieces and be blown away by the wind. Don't make a mess. Don't bring fur that sheds like a sick dog, no sequins, and no glitter. This is a strong cultural imperative; expect disapproving looks and comments should you disregard this piece of advice.
	-   A word on **biodegradable glitter**. Over the last few years people have started to talk about the wonders of biodegradable glitter, and how great it is for burning man. This is **not** right for two reasons:
		1.  For any biodegradable matter to effectively biodegrade it generally needs two things: time and humidity. The glitter does not have time to biodegrade during the time after the event and before the inspection. So it will be part of the problem when the time comes to make sure we can make it back to Black Rock.
		2.  Even if it biodegrades, the subproducts of biodegradation are introduced in the food cycle of the alga plants that grow in the lake when it rains. If the alga grows too much it blocks the sunlight that helps some shrimp larvae at the bottom of the lake to hatch, so it decreases the food supply for migrating birds that travel through Black Rock, disturbing the ecosystem. So there you have it. It is not cool.

6.  **Daytime and nighttime goggles**. There will be strong winds and lots of dust in the air; eye protection is critically important: nothing will stop your enjoyment of the event more than particulate in your eye. Some people wear sunglasses, which is better than nothing but provides little protection during dust storms (aka whiteouts). Chemistry or construction goggles or ski masks are generally a better option ([link 1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O3K5RSS/), [link 2](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DPG82-11-Concealer-Anti-Fog-Safety/dp/B01A12J3GI/), [link 3](https://www.amazon.com/Dewalt-DPG82-21-Concealer-Anti-Fog-Safety/dp/B000RKQ1O2/), [link 4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006WPSEAK/), [link 5](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GU3EB6/), [link 6](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CVXW1K/)). For night time, goggles should be clear. I suggest you purchase a few options and find the right fit.
    
7.  **Face (and lung) protection**. During whiteouts it is a very good idea to have some kind of dust protection. Playa dust is alkaline and so very very tiny (few times smaller than talcum), so tiny once it gets into your lungs it does not get out again. It can (and will, in time) give you [playa lung](https://burners.me/2012/10/28/playa-dust/) (medical term [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic_pneumonia)). To protect yourself you need an [N95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html) graded mask. You can get a [fancy mask](https://respro.com/pollution-masks), [another one](http://vogmask.com). While SARS-CoV-2 has upped the game of face masks, and the options are wide and large, remember that cotton layered masks are not as effective as N95/KN95/SPPF2 at stopping small particles.  
    [Disposable respirators](https://www.amazon.com/3M-8511-Particulate-Respirator-10-Pack/dp/B0002YKBV2) are an option, but they look objectively bad and their disposable nature makes them less than ideal. There are plenty of other fun & creative ways to cover your face that also don't produce garbage. But if you do decide to bring those disposable respirators, consider decorating them ;)

8.  **Large mirror**. You will want to look at your awesome outfits and make sure everything is a-ok. Something [like this for around $7](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-13-x-49-Door-Mirror/50110381?variantFieldId=actual_color) will make your life significantly better. Keep inside your tent or truck (if you brought one), as you dont want it to fly and shatter. [Another foldable option](https://ovationgear.com/products/folding-mirror.html), albeit a bit more expensive.
    
9.  **Lights**. Don’t be a “darkwad” - deck yourself out with lights (use LED string ligths, or EL Wire if you want to have that vintage feel) to make sure you’re visible at night. To minimize [MOOP](https://burningman.org/event/preparation/leaving-no-trace/moop/), skip the disposable glow gear, like glow sticks, or glow bracelets, and get battery-powered or rechargeable items. Glow sticks are also less visible once everything and everyone starts lighting at night, and once their chemicals start fading, you cannot replace their batteries to get that light going on again.


## Personal Care

1.  **Sunscreen**. Lots of it. One large bottle will be enough for two people for a week with plenty to spare.

2.  **Wet wipes**.  They will be your best friend on the playa. You can basically "wash" yourself with these every night (before going to bed, avoiding getting all that alkali dust inside your sleeping bag, or your sheets) and it does a decent job of replacing a shower. Two packs should be enough for two people. There is a brand called [Water wipes](https://www.waterwipes.com/uk/en/products/baby-care-products/baby-wipes) that contains nothing else than water and fruit extract, and are biodegradable.

    Absolutely **don't throw them into the porta-potties**; this can clog the cleaning trucks and will severely compromise the event’s ability to frequently clean the porta-potties that you’ll be wanting to use in a few minutes.

    A substitute for wet wipes are “[shower wipes for camping](https://www.google.com/search?q=shower+wipes+for+camping)”. Like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074DYPZYK/), or [these](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B00KVO5MRG/r-wet-wipes-20).

3.  **SPF lip balm**. This doesn't need explaining. [Take a couple](https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Down-Wind-Balm-Pack/dp/B00CQA2A6E/); you will probably lose one.

4.  **Disposable toilet seat covers**. If you are especially grossed out by the porta-potties, disposable seat covers can help with the situation.

5.  **Pee funnel**. Useful for those who prefer to pee standing. [Link](https://www.amazon.com/pStyle-Lavender/dp/B002AA8GDG/).

6.  **Single ply bathroom tissue**. Not two, not three, ONE ply. 2-ply or other kinds of toilet paper damages the servicing equipment that is used to clean the portos several times a day (read more [here](https://burningman.org/event/preparation/playa-living/human-waste-disposal/)). A couple of rolls is all you need for two people. Toilet paper is supplied by the event, but keep one of these in your backpack (in a ziplock baggie to keep it from fraying) in case your porta-potty has run out (this can happen pretty frequently).

7.  **Saline nasal spray**. Lots of dust tends to do a number on your nose. You will be blowing black boogers… It will happen. Saline nasal spray a couple of times a day will help you deal with it. You can also use vaseline, [nasal Ayr gel](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/ayr-saline-nasal-gel/ID=prod4998-product), or xylitol sprays.

8.  **Eye drops**. Clears out your eyes and feel fantastic in the dry environment. Carry one in your day bag and use as often as you feel like.

9.  **White vinegar diluted in water** in a 1:5 ratio is a perfect solution to wash playa dust off, especially for your feet if you decided to go the flip-flop route. Put it in a spray bottle and wipe it down with wet wipes, or better yet small hand towels. Apple vinegar smells nice too.
	> I use a resealable container where I put some Water Wipes and pour some vinegar, and use some of those wipes to clean my hands few times a day. During the Temple Build it helped me have some painless hands after 1 months of playa dust.
	> Witch hazel is sold in individual sachets, which you can carry around for when you need them.

10. **Work gloves**. These will make your manual labor much more pleasant and less injury prone. Inexpensive options are available at “dollar stores” and hardware stores.

11. **First aid kit**. We have a first aid tent for more serious issues; the following will help you self-care quickly:
	- Band-aids.
	- Polysporin triple antibiotic cream applied to the skin surface after scratches & cuts. Note: Neosporin is another option, but it contains neomycin, which is a common allergen.
	- Pain-killers that you’ve tried already and know won’t upset your stomach (or worse). Avoid gelcaps; they can turn into a [big mush](http://static.diffen.com/uploadz/c/c8/Advil-1.jpg) in the heat. My go-to is a generic migraine tablet combination of caffeine, acetaminophen, and aspirin: kicks pain from headaches and dehydration much faster than any other NSAID I’ve tried. (Foreign visitors: acetaminophen is the US name for paracetamol.)
	- Prescription medications, if you are taking some. In case those medications are essential, have a list printed, as it can be useful if you are not concious.

12. **Eyeglasses** are much safer than contact lenses. If you must wear contact lenses, go with one-day disposables - it is challenging to get lenses sufficiently clean, and you don’t want alkali playa dust eating away at your cornea. Avoid wiping dust and dirt off your glasses because it can scratch the glass, rinse them first, then wipe. You can also try applying one drop of dish detergent and smearing across both sides of both lenses, then rinse. They’ll sparkle without the skin oils and sunscreen on the lenses. Also try this at home.

13. **Ear plugs** for sleeping. Your tent might end up being behind a sound camp (or a camp that believes they are a sound camp) and you may have a hard time falling asleep without them.

14. **For hangover and dehydration**, you need electrolyte replacement. For an inexpensive solution, buy some “lite salt” which has both sodium and potassium, which you’ll dissolve in a liquid beverage, from water to tomato juice :-) A few drops of lemon juice (from a grocery store plastic lemon) will both mask the taste and make the combination easier to absorb.
There are a number of fantastic, already prepared options to purchase like Nuun tabs.


## Bike

[Why do you need a bike?](https://biketoeverything.com/2019/07/25/6-tips-burning-man-bike/) Distances at the burn are walkable, but if you are going with friends, you might end up walking to places while your friends are mobile, and when you get there they have already moved to the next place. Or something is happening in 10 minutes and you are 30 mins away. For reference [maps updated for 2023](https://imgur.com/a/DwALGsM):

1. **Seriously consider renting a bike**.

    WARNING: **Starting 2020, theme camps that offer fee-based bike rentals are not permitted to provide any rental services on playa. These camps will need to coordinate and complete all bike rentals, pick-ups, and drop-offs outside of Black Rock City.** So if you rent a bike from any of the shops that used to bring the bikes to playa, you will need to bring it to the event yourself, or coordinate with someone to do it for you.
    
    For the new out-of-playa rental, there are few options out there. A somehow updated list [here](https://burningman.org/event/preparation/getting-around/bikes/bike-repair/). Some renters may refuse renting for Burning Man.
    > I have been a camper at [PlayaBikeRepair](http://playabikerepair.com) in the past and they provide a great service repairing several thousand bikes during the event. They also clean and repair the bikes before the event. Machete.

2. **Cheaper is (kind of) better**. If you decide to bring your own bike, don't bring your $2000 TREK. Seriously.

   But don't bring a piece of crap. After several burns repairing bikes at Playa Bike Repair, I strongly recommend not getting cheap pieces of garbage with wheels. If you want to go to the cheapest, not crap option, consider spending a bit more ($180 instead of $100) and get a [Huffy Cranbrook beach cruiser](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Huffy-26-Cranbrook-Men-s-Cruiser-Bike-with-Perfect-Fit-Frame/109248326): less moving parts, fat tires, comfortable saddle.

3. The sweet spot is called **sealed hubs**. If you have some money to spare, use it. A bike with sealed hubs will go a longer way than open ones (the Huffy Cranbrook has opens hubs, and they get packed with dust, sometimes ruining the bike completely). If you don’t have the money but have the skills, get the bike in advance, open the hubs with some cone wrenches, and apply a thick layer of heavy grease, effectively creating a seal. This way the dust will take longer to get inside and mix with the oil/grease breaking the bearing balls.

4. **Single gear**. A bike with oiled moving parts will end up accumulating the corrosive dust and will end up failing, even after a few days. Those bikes with internal gear systems are generally better, especially with windy days, but they really need to be sealed (and they are not cheap). External gears (derraileurs) are also dust magnets. Consider the playa a long flat surface that is (again, unless it gets very windy) very bikeable without gears. A derraileur is great for moving around when you want to go visit all that deep playa art, but make sure you clean the oil and use dry lube, to avoid getting it all dusty.

5. **Bike lock**. Thieves? Opportunistic burners who “need” to “borrow” your bike? Confusion between bikes, both day and night? Avoid all these problems by buying a [simple, cheap and keyless lock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BVXDZM/) ([same idea just with letters](https://www.amazon.com/Wordlock-CL-411-BK-4-Letter-Combination-5-Feet/dp/B001AJ1AV8/)). Remember the combination, write it down on a piece of paper and keep it in your day bag. If the lock comes with a little metallic tag, attach it to one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MHUWXHO/) and have it at all times with you. Some people print the combination on the lock itself, or written on the back of the bike tag (see next), so that casual borrowers feel deterred, but all their friends know where it is and they can get the bike in case of an emergency.
    - Alternatively, (albeit discouraged) you can get a key lock and wear key as a necklace (or using [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MHUWXHO/)) so you minimize the risk of losing it. If your bike lock gets jammed, try blowing the dust out and/or smacking it around a bit to loosen up the dust.
	- Another way to deter people from taking your bike is to park it upside down.
	- ***The BEST way*** to avoid getting your bike borrowed is to get a [swing bike](https://www.americasbikecompany.com/2021-Swing-King-Elite-Disc-p/abc-2021-swingkingelite.htm). But is only for the braves.

6. **Label your bike**. Write your name, playa address & camp name on a piece of painter’s tape or duct tape with a Sharpie marker and stick it on your bike. Or you can use a luggage tag. Some people will be considerate and bring your bike back to your camp if they find it abandoned.

7.  **Lights**. Make your bike and yourself visible at night ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Fashionlite-Flexible-Waterproof-Versatile-Supply/dp/B01ALFBYBM/), [link](https://www.amazon.com/RTGS-String-Lights-Battery-Operated/dp/B004DZBYXK/)).

8.  **Identify your bike**. Day or night, once you park the bike, it becomes a needle in a haystack. How can you find it?
	- **Day**: Get a [bike safety flag](https://www.amazon.com/Trademark-Innovations-Bicycle-Mounting-Bracket/dp/B06XFT37DB) and make it unique. [Example](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM6O1KXZV8hAf0foK1EdKhJzf6KFsa2PXslWanfRr_mz48LaqzYUgVNqra6JBQ3dg/photo/AF1QipPqJtkNBZ4D7zyrAggj0Q1YjrD5GMuHo0pCH1qi?key=LTJyWHg1aFFpMXM5YTlLeUozWW4xR2d5SUQ1ZGRR). The camp “[Soon to be infamous](https://soontobeinfamous.weebly.com/)” organizes workshops on playa where they gift flags that you can decorate, but if you prepare with time you can be creative.
	- **Night**: You can use the same pole to put some [decorative LEDs](https://photos.app.goo.gl/TYtzk6RZb94PBFXX7). If you are versed in programming Arduino, you can get very creative.

10. **Decorate your bike**. What better way to identify your bike than decorating it in a non-MOOPy way? Add fur, zip ties, cover it in colorful duct tape, spray paint it with a rainbow, or cover it in LED lights.

11. **Fat tires**. Thin tires will cut through dust patches, and make your bike very unstable. Somehow thick tires will provide a smoother ride and let your get through the dust piles. Some people claim [this fat tire bike](https://www.amazon.com/Mongoose-All-Terrain-Mountain-Drivetrain-26-inch/dp/B0145730UK/) is the absolute, most comfortable ride on the playa; it's like riding on clouds. However, they are generally very heavy; if you are small and lightweight, you would be better off with a regular "[beach cruiser](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Huffy-26-Cranbrook-Men-s-Cruiser-Bike-with-Perfect-Fit-Frame/109248326)" type of bike.

12. **Big and comfortable seat**. Get a [beach cruiser type of seat](https://www.amazon.com/Micargi-Saddle-Classic-Twin-spring-suspenion/dp/B00ATL0KWS/). Wrap it in some fabric or a towel, otherwise it will get very hot in the sun. This especially applies to people who ride mostly (or fully) bare ass.

13. **Have a tennis ball**.  [For the kick stand](http://burningtribe.com/images/TennisBallKickstand.jpg), so that it doesn't sink into the ground and tip your bike. You can use duct tape to firmly attach it.

14. **Maintain your bike**. Playa dust is corrosive: it's tough on the chain and gears. Clean and grease up key parts. [Dry chain lube](https://www.amazon.com/Finish-Line-Teflon-Bicycle-Chain/dp/B002IDZXRM/) is better, as dust will not stick to it (as much).

15. **Bike issues**. Bring spare parts and some basic tools. Watch some youtube videos for some basic repair skills and tips. If you have bigger issues with your bike, there are camps that provide bike maintenance; ask around and somebody will know of one close by. There's usually one at the 9 o'clock plaza, Playa Bike Repair.

16. **At night, park next to stationary objects when possible**. If you are going to hang out around an art car, finding your bike in the dark 3 hours later might be impossible. One year I went back three times to look for my bike next morning. Best thing is park it next to (but not attached to) an stationary art installation, or close to porta potties.

17. **Bike donations**. [Playa donation points](https://www.facebook.com/notes/black-rock-community-transit-yellow-bikes/handling-bikes-at-the-end-of-the-event/1080641872029787/) (2019) - There are a small number of camps approved to accept bicycle donations on site. The groups listed below have all been approved, and are putting the bikes to great causes. Please only donate YOUR bike that your brought with you, and no one else’s. Note: Each of these will likely hit capacity, so be prepared to take your bike offsite should these options no longer be available:
	- Yellow Bike Shop - Until our storage is at capacity, the Yellow Bike Program will accept donations of Huffy Cranbrook 26” bikes. They will be added to our fleet the following year. We will only accept the bike if it is free of duct tape, stickers, spray paint, and any other decorations time-consuming to remove.
	- Stars And Bikes - Approximately 2 out of 3 donated bikes will be shipped to Gambia in West Africa, and the rest will be re-rented at their sister camp Hammer And Cyclery the following year.
	- Hammer And Cyclery - This is predominantly a bike repair shop but they will accept a limited number of donations at the end of the event.
	- Playa Bike Repair - They only accept functional single speed bikes and non-department store derailleur bikes.
	- Art Bike Relief - This project is a not-for-profit social enterprise, whose mission is to utilize the waste of burners to help in disaster zones.

18. Post burn. If you decide to store your bike, bring it to a car wash and blow it with air, rinse it with water and soap, and lube it thoroughly (did I mention dry lube?), before putting it to sleep.

Summary:
    - Bring a bike that you can successfully transport to **and from** Black Rock City.
    - Bring a bike that you don't mind getting beat up and wouldn't be heartbroken if you never saw it again.
    - Bring a bike that you feel comfortable riding.
    - Bring a bike that's easy to maintain. The fewer places for dust to clog things up the better.
    - Bring a bike that's in good shape. If you have to spend the afternoon of your second day on Playa learning how to replace a pedal and crankshaft you might learn something fascinating, but it's probably not the activity you wanted to be doing that day.
    - Spend at least a couple hours riding your bike before you bring it to Burning Man. This will help get your body used to riding the bike, and it will highlight any needed maintenance.
    - Get a tune-up before Burning Man. Ideally, do the tune-up yourself so that you know how all the parts work. When you get home, do another tune-up, and wipe it down with a vinegar solution.
    - Decorate your bike (in a non-moopy way). A unique-looking bike is more obviously "not yours" (and less likely to get "borrowed") and easier to spot in a crowd.
    - A freshly-lubed bike chain is an act of self care. I do it at least every other day. Pedaling will be *soooo much easier* with some lube. Get some dry lube at a bike shop and make sure to put something under your bike while applying it so you don't moop it on the playa surface.



## Electric bikes and the like

Electric bikes are “street legal” during Burning Man. They must conform to Nevada state law definition of “e-bike” and obey the same 5MPH limit as everyone else. If you decide to go ahead and pull the expensive trigger, get the one with pedals so you can use it as a normal bike when discharged. Anything else (hoverboard, segway, monowheel, etc) will turn into a heavy brick that you need to carry. Bring a bike lock.

When riding a self-balancing electric vehicle (hoverboard, segway, monowheel), carry your charger so you can plug in almost anywhere, rest for half an hour, and then continue your journey. Learn to ride it ahead of time, while sober, on asphalted ground. Think about how you are going to lock it up using a bike lock, not all of them have holes for it. Some vehicles can be locked up using a phone, which is another expensive thing to carry around.

For full details, read the [Official Policy](https://burningman.org/event/art-performance/mutant-vehicles/vehicle-rules-and-protocols/).


## Night Time lighting

1. **Headlamp**. Get a [good one](https://amazon.com/PETZL-Headlamp-Lumens-Rechargeable-Battery/dp/B07RNMQC9Y/) that you don't have to press four times to get to the right mode. You won't be sorry. Consider one that has night mode (red light) and remember to point it down away from people's faces (or wear it around the neck when you are not actively using it). Have at least one spare and don't forget to put the new batteries in. Odds are, they will last you through the week. Finally, you don't need the most powerful one that can light up the moon. Wear it around your neck, point it down at your feet, everyone will see you and you can see where you are stepping. When riding a bike, put it back on your head.

2. **EL wire**. This is one of the most useful and versatile things ever, albeit somewhat fragile ([link](https://amazon.com/Lychee%C2%AE-Battery-Parties-Halloween-Decoration/dp/B00EJBT57K/)).

3. **Misc wearable LEDs** ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Accmor-Seasonal-Decoration-Waterproof-Operated/dp/B018K40EKS/), [link](https://www.amazon.com/LampLust-Multicolored-Battery-Operated-Functions/dp/B00FQMYNS2/))

4. In all cases, **be visible at night**. Light is not just about you seeing in the dark, it's about making sure you are visible to bikes and cars. Do NOT get run over. ALWAYS wear lights at night.


## Water

1.  **1.5 GL (~7 litre) per day per person**. You might need less, but until you are aware of your own water consumption patterns, be safe and stick with the [official recommendation](https://burningman.org/event/preparation/playa-living/water/).
	- Use electrolyte tablets like [nuun](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nuun).
	- You can rent full 6GL “office cooler” bottles in Reno and return them empty. They can be filled with normal water or water with electrolytes.

2.  **Backpack with a water bladder**. Self explanatory. Get one that can also be used as a day bag (see below). You can also buy a separate bladder and attach it inside your backpack (some are even bladder-ready). Consider a two-bladder system if you want to carry other liquids alongside your water (alcohol, energy drink).

3.  **Spray/mist bottle** can do wonders in heat and could last you pretty much all day. Ask for consent before spraying other people on playa.


## Day/Night Bag

Here's what's in my day bag, more or less:

1. **Water**.

2. Small tube of **sunscreen** (during the day).

3. SPF **lip balm**.

4. **Toilet paper**, 1 ply ONLY. Don't have to carry the whole roll, just a few feet. You can also use it as napkins on the go.

5. A **tag** with name, playa address and camp name.

6. Small **notebook** and a pencil attached with a string. Write your name and camp info in the first page, with a clear “If found, please return to…” on top.

7. Saline **nasal spray**.

8. A **cup** or sipping bottle. Attached to my utility belt with a carabiner.

9. Some form of **ID**
	- In previous years I had no problems showing a color photocopy of my ID attached to my cup, using packing tape (see [this thread](https://eplaya.burningman.org/viewtopic.php?t=33381) for inspiration).
	- The photocopy was denied as a form of ID in some places, so I also carry an expired copy of my driver's license with me, just in case. In some countries / states you can head to your local DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles, or whatever entity handles your driver’s license or national ID card) and request a copy. In some places the department sends a new copy when you update your address, or add a motorcycle license to your license, or when it expires. Take the copy with you and keep it somewhere safe with you at all times, in case your photocopy does not work. An expired passport might also be a good idea.
	- If you have some severe allergies, bring a laminated card with those allergies clearly indicated and put in the same place where you carry your ID, perhaps around your neck or on your utility belt, whenever you go out and about.


10.  Collapsible **plate** and a **spork**, good for the times when people offer you food ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Collapsible-Silicone-Approved-Expandable-Carabiner/dp/B019B53YVQ/), [link](https://www.rei.com/product/782971/sea-to-summit-delta-bowl), [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LGCDEE/), [link](https://www.rei.com/product/782242/sea-to-summit-alpha-light-spork)).

12. A Swiss army **knife**.

13. **Mints**.

14. Cheap **camera** if you are into taking pictures. Or an old phone with an integrated camera.
    > I personally have moved from taking pictures to enjoy the moment.

15. A few **snacks**. Avoid chocolate & yogurt stuff during the day, they will turn into mush.

16. If you smoke, an empty altoids tin as **a portable ashtray**.

17. A medium resealable **bag for trash**.

18. ~~$20 bucks in cash for 5am coffee at the centre camp.~~ No more coffee at centre camp.

19. Condoms and [individual packets of lube](https://mypleasurebox.com/products/pjur-original-bodyglide-1-5-ml-bag-of-150-foils).

20. [**Ear Plugs**](https://www.amazon.com/Etymotic-Research-High-Fidelity-Earplugs-Standard/dp/B0044DEESS/) to save your ears from loud music when necessary. [Tinnitus](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tinnitus/symptoms-causes/syc-20350156) is real.

21. **Sunglasses** (even at night, if you plan to stay up for the sunrise).

22. **A soft flask** is perfect to bring some refreshments with you. Fill up 1-2 500ml flask and off you go. When empty they fold down very well and don't take up much room in your backpack. It's a good idea to rinse and air-dry it out after each use ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Speed-Flask-Clear-500ml/dp/B01HNUSIJ4/)).



## Tent

1. **Playa-ready tents**. You should be able to comfortably keep your clothes and food inside, have some space to change clothes, and maybe invite some friends. A tent for 2 people fits 2 people sleeping on the ground, touching each other (prepare for “very snuggly” conditions) so you may want to err on the larger side. Here are some options:
	- [Coleman Instant Cabin](https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Cabin-Instant-Camping-Seconds/dp/B004E4AVY8/): easy to set up, cheap, durable, with vents (as they are not zippered, they may need to be sealed with duct tape or stuffing them with t-shirts).
	- [Shiftpod](http://shiftpod.com/): Expensive but excellent. Compact, spacious, very sturdy, very fast to set up and break down, has good resale value. Order in advance, they go out of stock before Burning Man. Needs a shade structure.
	- [Kodiak](https://www.amazon.com/Kodiak-Canvas-Flex-Bow-4-Person-Deluxe/dp/B002QZUOTE/): [I have one of these](https://photos.app.goo.gl/imBWzVPvXJMM8Y3M8), and I love it. Although it is quite heavy, it is very water resistant, [wind resistant](https://photos.app.goo.gl/vKZgaJQf7yoCF6Zz8) (compare with [this](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ng5iTV26q5ZrUNuRA); those 2 pictures were taken with the wind blowing hard), very durable (7 burns already, and still going strong), simple to put up (I have done it without any help), and tall enough to stand inside. We camp two people in this [10x10 model](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O02TK4). The mesh panels are zippered inside, so you don’t need to use duct tape to cover them. Also, no guy wires! Needs shade structure.
    ![Kodiak tent with aluminet 70%](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVnM9Swnyb8SjurrUNKDl_4rQgGqfuEiYDtFz0BobbALRVTMLmCJmnJmeNCxKEkllh2t6WIeiaTop_jdn9nd6esASZbCSHOe7gk1d1SSRK2xadUvkxVh2nxHlVuhI8CLqwXa-kj27ayfHze5PIwg_tQCA=w2863-h1610-no?authuser=0)
    - [Springbar tent](https://springbar.com/): They are similar to the Kodiak (some folks say Kodiak stole the Springbar design) and perform similarly well in BRC.
	- [Lotus](http://lotusbelle.com/) does look very cool, slick and sexy, but it's a huge pain to set up and gets very hot.
	- [No Bake Tent](https://www.nobaketent.com/) - stays much cooler than a shiftpod or kodiak, packs up smaller than both too. Designed for desert living! [Burner post](https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/forum/#!searchin/burners/no$20bake$20tent%7Csort:date/burners/_ZDvG91F5RA/MUzK2CjgBAAJ) about no-bake vs. shiftpod

7. **Non playa-ready tents**. Although I don’t recommend it, some people bring tents that are really [not ready for playa](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ng5iTV26q5ZrUNuRA). Hiking tents are designed to favor portability, breathability and weight, compromising in resulting living space and other factors. Hiking tents designed for summer tend to have a large anti-mosquito mesh. The playa dust is so fine that the interior will get all covered in dust if you don’t seal them. Small mesh vents are ok, as you can seal them off with duct tape, or some other way.

8. **Shade**. [Most tents will need a shade](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kBpRucNsxu4nyU4o8), otherwise they turn into an oven at some point during the day.
   - **Materials**. The best shade material is some form of cloth with an embedded layer of reflective material.
       - The most cost-effective one is a heavy duty tarp with one layer of aluminum on one side (or aluminium, for those that know how to spell it properly). You can find it as "tarp with aluminum" around the web. It is best used [attached to a structure](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59776648cf81e03bebdcdc52/1557858282952-T3NE2NHSIXWL20XZEVDD/AngledShade.jpg), due to its rigidity.
       - There are other more expensive options (and also take more space and do not provide 100% cover), like 70% or 80% aluminet. One advantage of aluminet, though, is that you can use it to cover your tent [camo style](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kBpRucNsxu4nyU4o8) and the holes provide a free way for the hot air to escape.
       - Beware the mylar thin “survival” material, like those thin emergency blankets: it tears, it’s loud in the wind, and it’s hard to secure to the tent. I have seen it used glued to a heavyduty tarp, but it needs preparation pre-playa. You probably need to experiment with different glue types to find the optimal one.
       - Other less expensive materials include [plain tarps or webbing without aluminum](https://nyd.nyc/assets/images/gallery03/1ec5f52e_original.jpg). They can be used to provide shade.
       - NEW! Shade cloth is generally considered a superior choice than a heavy-duty tarp because wind can go through it, so your structure is less likely to blow away and so that heat under the shade can rise up and out.
   - **Structure**. Some companies offer [modular shade options](https://photos.app.goo.gl/imBWzVPvXJMM8Y3M8), which can be expanded based on your growing needs: [link](https://formandreform.com/blackrock-hardware-3/). There are DIY options: [here](https://www.theplayalabs.com/shady-business) you can find a website with a step-by-step procedure and links to the places you can source materials and elements. Some [other websites](http://ysbw.com) sell all the elements needed for this type of shade. 

9. **Stake your tent**. If you get a basic tent (like the Coleman Instant Cabin), use [these tent stakes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R4S3NS2/), instead of the included flimsy crap that they usually come with. You can drive them all the way into the ground to reduce tripping hazard. They are obviously not as strong as rebar, but your average tent is more likely to collapse than fly away. For more anchoring power, like shade structures offered by [Form & Reform](https://formandreform.com/blackrock-hardware-3/), [12 inch lag bolts](https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=1086) are recommended. The minimum recommended length is 12 inches to reach under the crusty, dry surface and into the packed underlayer. Some extra lengthy lag bolts (18 inches, or even longer) are recommended for heavy duty uses. If your stakes/rebar/bolts/whateves are not completely inserted into the ground, cover them with tennis balls or beer cans or pool noodles or other [protective solutions](https://www.google.com/search?q=rebar+covers) to avoid serious injuries.

10. **Cover your bed**. Have a separate blanket to cover your bed after you get up. Roll it gently down before going to sleep for near dust free clean bed.

11. **Small rug at the door** will keep dust off your shoes and will help to keep dust out from the rest of your dwelling. The Galaxia Temple build crew used CGEAR Sand-Free outdoor camping mats for the kitchen area and they worked like magic: [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NARMCS).

12. **Rug/carpet inside your tent**. This is a plan for 2020: will bring a fluffy rug to put on the floor (we used a towel in 2019) so that’s more comfy to walk without shoes inside.

    Other people have been using microfiber chenille bath rugs, and the claim is that they work fabulously in tents or RVs for soaking up dust. They are machine washable / dryable, and come in a range of different sizes. A common setup is a small one for a doormat/shoes area, and a large one inside your RV/tent: [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07DPDF6QF/)

13. **Rope tighteners** are perfect for setting up those guy wires ([link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN6CWY/)). Alternatively, [learn your knots](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/tautline-hitch).

14. **Solar LED string**. Put those around your tent and inside for comfort and safety ([link](https://www.amazon.com/INST-Powered-Ambiance-Lighting-Christmas/dp/B00KGOCRLA/)).

15. **Mark guy wires**. Try to light up your guy wires AND stakes so that people don't break their faces walking around your tent. [Solar LED strings](https://www.amazon.com/Lalapao-Powered-Outdoor-Waterproof-Christmas/dp/B06WVYH39G/) are also perfect for this. You can either place them around the tent or (and?) on the guy wires.

16. **Working gloves**. You want to have a pair for setting and tearing down your camp. Protect your hands. ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanix-Wear-MultiCam-2-Pack-Gloves/dp/B07GBRSCWF/))

17.  **Take your shoes off before entering the tent. Even for one second. Even if you just laced up.**


## Living Comfort

1. **A cheap watch**. Good to have to keep track of time and set alarms ([link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAWSDG/)).

2. **Air mattress**. This is the best way to sleep on the playa. Make sure to have a warm blanket to cover yourself with and to sleep on. [Exped MegaMat Duo 10 Sleeping Pad](https://www.amazon.com/Exped-MegaMat-Duo-Sleeping-Pad/dp/B00PZKU3F2/) is absolutely, hands down, the best air mattress that has ever been made. There's a good chance it's more comfortable than your actual home mattress. If the MegaMat is out of your price range, [SoundAsleep Dream Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FAW4O0A/) is a great budget option. The best thing to do is to buy a cheap queen size blow up mattress and use it as a base for the MegaMat, to create a regular height bed. This works remarkably well in terms of comfort. You will have to readjust the MegaMat as it will shift around a bit every few days.

3. **Sleeping cot**. If you don't have space for a large blow up mattress, or simply have a preference for things that don’t have a tendency to puncture, a [sleeping cot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LF3G7M/) ([alternative](https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-2000020273-32-Inches-Pack-Away-Cot/dp/B0043AK0O4/)) is the next best thing. Add some padding on top, like an [army surplus wool blanket](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HMHW2A), and it's infinitely better than sleeping on the ground. Plus you have all the space underneath so you can use some boxes to organize all your clothes.

4. **Ear plugs**. If you are a light sleeper, you might want to bring some earplugs. It will never be completely quiet around. Some people even use [ear muffs](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Behind-Earmuffs-Conservation-H6B/dp/B009POJ3GY).
	- **Eye shades** are a great addition if you don’t like waking up with the first light.

5.  **Have shade**. If you have a regular tent, you will absolutely want to have some type of shade over it. It can be a purpose built shade structure or a [shadow from a truck/RV](http://octopup.org/img/burning-man/2009/m/20090829-1225-P3VV0--BM2009--0030--Saturday-Before--Camp--Sportsmobile--Drifty.jpg), or a piece of aluminet 70% covering the tent.

6. **Simple wire shelving** can help keep the tent looking less like your entire supply of whippets suddenly exploded. Be sure to check dimensions so that everything fits ([link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DGM4IU/), [link](https://www.amazon.com/Whitmor-6779-4415-5-Tier-Shelf-Tower/dp/B009KB7XBE/)).
 
7. **Sitting fixture**. You can make one of [these](https://www.instructables.com/id/Multi-Function-Walking-Stick-Converts-into-a-Cha/). I like the idea of a walking stick that can be collapsed, and also used as a chair when needed. Sometimes I want the sitting option, like when you are waiting for something to burn after hours of walking around.


## Food

This topic is wide and infinite, these are just some of the many, many options available to you:

1. **Freeze-dried food**. It's great for carefree lunches, breakfasts, and dinners. You can get a [large pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00955DUHQ/) that should last you most of the week. The flavor is surprising palatable, if you haven't tried these before, try each flavor before committing for a whole week.

2. You can **pre-cook your meals at home**. If you can, cook, vacuum seal, and freeze your food ahead of time so that it's easy to heat up on the playa for a fresh meal. Soupy things like curry and gumbo work great!

3. **Store-bought pre-cook food**. [Tasty bite](https://www.tastybite.com/) indian pouches are fantastic. Mix one with sauce and one with rice, and you have a fantastic meal.

4. **Ramen**. Basic and cheap. For some reason ramen tastes great on the playa in cold and hot weather. You can [cold soak](https://www.google.com/search?q=darwin+on+the+trail+cold+soaking) your food, if you plan ahead, so that you don’t need to boil water.

5. **Granola/energy bars**. Make sure they don't have chocolate or yogurt in them or they will be a melted mess all over your hands ([Kind bars link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JKSJJ2/)).

6. **Meal replacements**. A popular meal replacement is Ensure. I usually take the chocolate version and have one in the morning with my coffee if I am in a hurry to get somewhere (morning Ranger shifts start at ~5:45) and cannot (or don’t want to) cook. I also put one in my day carry bag.
**Soylent**, **yFood**, **Huel** and similar products are becoming more and more popular, now available in supermarkets. They are sold in plastic bottles (more trash) and powder (needs to be mixed, moopy if it is windy).  
	> I tested soylent for 2 weeks in the default world, and unlike [some people around the internet](https://www.everywhereist.com/i-tried-soylent-it-didnt-go-well/), I did not have any problems. Three bottles a day (morning and mid-day with coffee, and evening vanilla flavour) helped keep the hunger at bay, and made me feel satiated all day long.

7. **No cooler options**. Bring things like fresh-ground peanut butter (for protein), granola, single-serving 8oz/235ml milk (or milk replacement) cartoons, trail mix, single-serving snacks for on-the-go (Spam singles, tuna fish pouches, halva bars, granola bars, apple sauce packets, ...), Tasty Bite Indian food pouches, ... and so on. The key here is that the heat of the playa often takes away your appetite, but if you haven't eaten all day you can suddenly get hungry: get those calories in whenever you are hungry and wherever you happen to be, so pocket-size food that doesn't need utensils is a huge win. Make sure you've got a secure place to put your wrappers when you're done (back in your bag or in a deep pocket). When you are around your camp, you can eliminate cooking (and thus having to bring propane and a cooking stove), and get all the calories and nutrients you need.

7. **No watermelon**.  [Burning Man Guide](http://burningman.org/event/preparation/leaving-no-trace/lighter-trash/) has this to say about watermelon: "Forget the watermelon; you’re not going to eat it. Every year, people leave a mountain of watermelons behind, and they never get eaten." If you REAAAAAAALLY want watermelon, pre-cut it into cubes at home, store it in sealed containers, freeze/chill the cubes and you’ll have a wonderful convenient cold finger dessert in the desert. Seedless is a good option to reduce the possibility of creating MOOP.

8. **Free food**. Tons of camps give out food and drinks so you can save some appetite for playa adventures. Obviously this isn't something you should actually rely on.

9. **Delicious java**. Center camp does not sell coffee anymore.
	- Starbucks sells two products that I love: via instant coffee (you can mix it with some warm water and add ice to drink it cold) and double shot cans (espresso coffee with milk, fantastic when cold or warm).
	- I tried cold brewing once in playa and didn't go well. I brought a containers that was way too small for when the bean bag expanded and was really hard to dispose the wet bag. If you want to cold brew, I recommend using a food grade bucket and definitely prepare for the disposal.
	- Some people have been suggesting something like [this one](https://www.handpresso.com/en/handpresso-pump-black-351.html). I have personally not used it, but it is supposed to deliver good coffee.

10. **Ice**. Sold for $10 a bag (16 pounds, crushed) or $5 blocks (7 pounds), from 9am to 6pm at 9:00+G and 3:00+G portals and Center Camp ([full details](https://survival.burningman.org/city-infrastructure/on-playa-resources/)). Have a cart (or get a bike with a cargo option) and work gloves; lugging ice on your back for 10 minutes is not fun.
	- If you can prepare ahead, freeze a bunch of bottles of gatorade and drop them in a cooler with some dry ice, separating the bottles and the ice with a towel. You can use the bottles as ice for the food (see the Two-cooler system section, below), and once the gatorade melts you can drink it cold.
	- Reusable heavy-duty ice bags like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MT9VMSQ) can hold crushed ice; as the ice melts, it turns into cold potable water which you can dispense from the built-in spout into another container. This can reduce the amount of water you need to bring, though you should never depend on being able to re-supply with ice while on the playa.  One bag of crushed ice from Arctica fills three 5 lb bags with a little left over.
	- Pre-event, ice is available at two locations: Center Camp Arctica, Thursday through Sunday from noon to 6 pm; and Ice 9 (9:00+G), Saturday and Sunday pre-event from noon to 6 pm.
	- **NEW** Credit cards, Apple Pay, and cash are accepted at all locations. You read that right… You can now pay for ice with credit cards / Apple Pay! No more loose cash needed! Consider paying with a credit card in 2022.

11. **Dry Ice**. A 30-person camp required $300 worth of dry ice, which is less than we typically spend on normal ice and it requires no trips to Arctica.
	- Dry ice can be dangerous so please research the [safe handling rules](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-handle-dry-ice-safely-606403) first. In simple terms:
		1. It is extremely cold. It will burn your bare hands like open fire. **Use gloves**.
		2. It evaporates into CO2, which is heavier than air and will eventually replace air inside a car or a small room, suffocating anyone in there. **Keep it in open space**.
		3. The evaporated gas expands and will blow up a tightly sealed container. Keeping it in an **unlocked** cooler is a good idea.

15. **Two-cooler system**. Best way to keep your food chilled without infrastructure support is using the two-cooler system. One cooler is filled with dry ice, another with food. Once a day quickly transfer a brick of dry ice into the food cooler, everything will stay chilled for a whole week pretty easy. During the day, cover your coolers with your night coats to help it stay more insulated.  
I personally use two coolers (you can see them in [this picture](https://photos.app.goo.gl/imBWzVPvXJMM8Y3M8)) without dry ice: one for drinks (gets open frequently) and one for food (only when meals are happening; the food cooler is drained every day). I cover the food one with a “jacket” made of [reflectix](https://www.google.com/search?q=reflectix) and duct tape. The food container has inside some tall cereal plastic containers for food that should not get wet.

16. **Plate, fork, knife, and a spoon**. Bring your own plate, a fork, a knife, and a spoon. Also, a bowl. Wash (clean them) them after every use. Collapsible [doggie bowl](https://www.amazon.com/Collapsible-Silicone-Approved-Expandable-Carabiner/dp/B019B53YVQ/) works fantastically well. Use a rubber or hair band to keep cutlery in a tight bunch or keep them in a ziplock bag. I got a [fork-and-spoon combo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LGCDEE/) (and a [spork](https://www.amazon.com/COSMOS-Stainless-Sporks-Household-Camping/dp/B01LPMG9RE/), for added redundancy) and a [swiss army knife with a corkscrew and a can opener](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001P15JY/).

17. **Wrap plates in saran wrap**. This will help remove the need to wash the plates, but will add some garbage. Still, gray water is much heavier than a foot of saran wrap.

18. **Don't bring anything in glass bottles** unless you camp with a camp with infrastructure. You will have to carry empty bottles back. Either buy stuff in cans or paper cartons, or transfer into plastic containers.


## Lifestyle

1. [**Polyphasic Sleep Schedule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep). It's impossible to see and do everything the playa has to offer. However, you can maximize your exposure to night and day time with a simple change in your sleep schedule. Go to sleep around 10pm, wake up around 3am, go out, meet the sunrise, go to sleep around 8am and wake up at 12pm.  
    Be aware that sleeping inside your tent during the day can only be achieved with some sleeping solution that provides a cool environment during sun hours (see the [tent section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbonW9_6hXM2S9sA6iGePHm1uz908cpsuvPHMoKoBMA/edit#heading=h.v86yktucduki)). If you are not preparing for that type of cool place, it might fail horribly. Plan accordingly. Some camps offer shaded hammocks to rest.

2. **Expect getting places taking twice as long**. You will want to stop by on the way, have a drink, dance at that 80s party, jump into kiddie pool full of stuffed animals, and do other fun things… in fact, your chances of getting to your destination are pretty low, so just relax about it.

3. **Time commitments**. You may make playa dates with new found friends. Those friends might miss those dates, then might show up to your camp at some random time to say hi. They are not flakes. They are just on playa time :)

4. **Sunrises**. A very special experience is the celebration of every sunrise on the playa. You absolutely want to meet at least one sunrise somewhere deep in the playa dancing in front of an art car or chilling in the dust.

5. **Put the cellphone away**. Seriously, this is the only place and time you can truly disconnect. Do it, I strongly suggest so.
	> In recent years there has been internet access available, albeit spotty, in playa. Some camps offer wifi connections through repeaters or satellite or other means. I personally have only used those in emergency situations.

6. **Getting ready takes time**. The larger your group is, the longer it will take to assemble everyone. It's like herding cats, seriously. So be chill about it. Consider dividing the larger into smaller groups, or even go exploring solo. And once you are out, don't get overly hung up on the group sticking together. It will only add stress.

7. **Playa has its own schedule**. Things may or may not happen in playa. The “What, where, when” book may have an event that you have been waiting to attend for days, and once you get there is not happening. Or that DJ you were told was gonna spin at 3am is not on time. Or had a heat stroke and has been substituted by someone else. Chill and enjoy.

7. **Sit down during the Man and Temple burns**, this makes it better for everyone. If can't sit on the ground too long, get one of these [foldable legless chairs](https://www.amazon.com/Crazy-Creek-Products-Original-Chair/dp/B0000D8HHX/).


## Relationship Advice

1. It is said that Burning Man is *tough on relationships*. That is not true. Burning Man is tough on couples when there's a lack of trust and communication.

2. Expect there to be many fun and attractive people, naked and otherwise.

3. Burning Man will most likely be difficult on your relationship if:
	- You and/or your partner have jealousy and/or communication issues.
	- You often fight during long trips.

4. Discuss beforehand:
	- How you want to spend your time, together and apart.
	- Your personal boundaries at Burning Man, what's OK and what isn't.

6.  Remember that tent's don't really have walls, everyone in your camp can hear you yell at each other. If you are having a fight, go for a walk and use your "inside" voice.

7.  Avoid making any rash decisions (proposals, weddings, break-ups, divorces) at Burning Man or in the weeks following the event. Same applies to lifestyle and career changes.


## Sex life

1. **Consent**. Before you do anything (even a hug! or misting someone), ask for consent. Even with your partner.

2. **No means no**. 'Maybe' means no. Silence means no. I don’t know means no. Only **enthusiastic consent** like “Hell yeah, let's do it” counts as consent.

3. **Inability to give consent means no**. People under influence **cannot** give consent. Even if they say yes, this is not consent. They are drunk. Needless to say, but **passed out means no**.

4. **Consent is not contractual**. Consent can be revoked at any time without explanation.

5. **Ask for ID**. Burning Man has no minimum age restriction. Nevada, however, has a minimum age of consent at 16 years. Happy consensual sex with a 15 year old is considered a statutory rape leading up to fifteen years in prison (ironically).

6. **Public sex is illegal**. Go to your tent or go to Orgy Dome. Contrary to what its name may imply, the Orgy Dome is not (just) a dome for orgies. Learn more about it [here](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-love-drive/burning-man-sex-what-you-JW7wKpg8icv/), [here](https://thewoolfer.com/2018/08/09/the-orgy-dome/) and [here](http://accuracythird.libsyn.com/s2e3-lazlo-final-v2).

7. **Sex with strangers**? Use condoms.


## Safety

1. **Watch your step**. Always, especially in the dark. There are guy wires everywhere and rebar sticking out of the ground. Don't run through tent land.

2. **Memorize landmarks**. Remember what every corner around your camp looks like during the day and night. When you walk out to the playa for the first time, turn around and look for landmarks again that you can walk back to 10 hours later. Do the same at night/day. All landmarks will change on Sunday; be prepared. People remove signal posts heading to the burn weekend. Be prepared. Remember (write down?) the precise location of your camp address: "7:28 and J on the Man side" is better than just "7:30 and J". "7:28 and J on the Man side with a yellow box truck" is even better.
	- If you are carrying a phone (meh :/) download the [map](https://unofficialbrcmap.com/).

3. **Drink water all the fucking time**. Like really, don't stop, keep drinking water with electrolytes ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Nuun-Hydration-Electrolyte-Essential-Electrolytes/dp/B019GU4ILQ/), [link2](https://www.amazon.com/Ultima-Replenisher-Electrolyte-Hydration-Stickpacks/dp/B01EGP1KYY/)).

4. **Memorize locations of porta potties**. Each location has a faint blue light a few feet above it in the air, however it's utterly useless during the day. At night, trying to spot a single light in a sea of other lights, especially with dilated pupils is a lost cause ([check out the map](https://unofficialbrcmap.com)).

5. **Emergency**. If you or somebody else is having trouble, reach out to one of the BRC Rangers (avoid law enforcement if possible). BRC Rangers are not police. Read more at the end of this doc.
	- If you have a medical emergency, there are medical outposts located at 9 & C, 3 & C, 5:45 & Esplanade (Rampart), 4:30 & 7:30 plazas (at H street), and an outpost located between the Man and the Temple
	- If there's blood, but it's not threatening, you have to go to medical around the center camp.
	- If the injury is serious but you are ok to walk, get to the closest medical station.
	- **Make sure to read the [How to deal with cops at Burning Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/4wjfuk/how_to_deal_with_cops_at_burning_man_2016_update/) guide from start to finish**.
	- **NEW** The Emergency Services Department’s on-site emergency dispatch center monitors a designated emergency channel that is available for your personal radios.
	    - **NOTE** this is a change from the past years in which the MURS (Multi User Radio Service) radio band was used. MURS will not be monitored for emergencies in 2022, which gives participants access to all five MURS channels for their needs.
	    - You can purchase your own radio to contact BRC 911. Large camps or villages might choose to make a radio part of their planning efforts and store it in a public place for emergency use. You might also be able to rent a radio from your local radio rental shop.
	    - Program your radio to 451.9000 MHz with a CTCSS/PL tone of 91.5 to reach the Black Rock City 911 Dispatch. This is limited to 4-watt power output (typical limit of most handheld radios). Please refer to your user manual to see how to program your radio.
	    - FOR ALL RADIO USERS: you are responsible for following FCC rules regarding programming. Not all radios meet FCC regulations for this specific frequency. This channel is licensed to Burning Man and you are being granted access to use this channel as an emergency reporting channel only. Unauthorized use could face fines imposed by the FCC.

6. **Calculate your risks**. Consider the risks of accepting drinks, food or drugs from strangers at random places if you are just wondering by yourself. Drinking at designated bars and eating at designated camps is certainly less risky.
	> Consider the risks of a drug offence, specially in situations like being a traveling foreigner, or you are living with a visa in the USA. The consequences may be devastating.

7. In general, keep an eye on your cup at all times when you are wandering around playa. There are reports of drinks getting spiked.

8. Post-pandemic (are whe there yet?): Carry an N95/PPF5 mask, if you are still trying to avoid the bug, so that you can enter places where ventilation may not be that great. Use it to respect Covid boundaries, as some people may not be comfortable without them. And to enter places that may have mask requirements. Also, wear one if you are not feeling well.


##  Before Leaving The House

Captain obvious here… I know...

1. Make sure you read the SURVIVAL GUIDE cover to cover long before the event, not on the ride up :-)

2. Make sure at home:
	- Lights are off
	- Taps(ak a water faucets) close.
	- Windows closed
	- Everything turned off that should be

3. Pay all the bills that will come due while you will be out.

4. You have your ticket, car pass (and Work Access Pass, or WAP, if you have one) & ID that matches your ticket purchase name.

5. An Work Access Pass is needed if you show up before the gates officially open.

6. Change your phone's login screen to have a photo of you, your actual name and your address on the playa.

7. Ensure you’ve got documents, credit cards, etc. in one place, preferably in a Ziploc® resealable baggie in one place for the entire event, whether that’s in the vehicle’s glove box or your primary backpack. Keep photocopies of everything in a separate place; note the phone numbers for the credit card (on the card back) on the photocopies.

8. Have all your prescription medicines in a quantity that’s more than your expected stay at the event. Divide them into two containers of each and pack them separately, so that any misadventure (loss, theft, water damage) will still leave you with half your supply, which will give you time to manage the situation. Dismiss this advice at your extreme peril.

9. If you have some severe allergies, carry an ID card and attach a laminated card with those allergies clearly indicated. Carry them around your neck or on your utility belt, when you go out and about.

10. If you are bringing your own car, consider bringing 2 copies of the car keys, and keep them in separate places during the burn.


## Driving In

1.  **There will be a line**. Have some food and water in the car, there are porta-potties throughout the line. Turn your engine off when standing to save gas.

2. **Have [will call](https://burningman.org/event/participate/volunteering/teams/box-office/) passengers?** If possible, split people up so that will call ticket holders are in a separate car. A single will call passenger sends the whole car off to a separate line, and that line can be very long. DO NOT jump out of your car in line to run to will call and get your tickets! You think it will save time but it will much more likely get you lost from your vehicle and make your entrance much harder. I know it seems like it will be easy to find your car again but every year hundreds of people lose their friends on the way in. Don't do it!
	> Make sure everyone in your car has a ticket or has a will call ticket. If any of your passengers does not have a ticket, the entire car will be sent back to Gerlach.

3. **Fill up close by**. Don't forget to fill up somewhere close by (Fernley is the best place, right before the 447), you don't want to get stuck without gas on the line, they have a special place where they send people who do. Just don't wait until Gerlach, or you will be standing in a line for gas as long as the gate line.

4. **Cover the seats and the floors**. If you cover the seats before getting to the playa, your clean up with be twice as easy. A $10 set of cheapest sheets from Walmart will do the job.

5. **Drink more water**. Start drinking more water in line to help your body adapt to the harsh environment.

6. **Wear the seatbelt**. There will be plenty of law enforcement around looking for an excuse to frisk your car, don't give them one.

7. **Observe speed limit**. When driving to the playa, especially if it's super obvious that you are, drive at posted speed limit from the moment you leave the house to the moment you park on the playa. Pay attention to separate speed limit signs if you have a trailer. You can be pulled over for going ONE mph over the speed limit.
	> Hundreds of people get pulled over and ticketed by the police every year for driving over the speed limit while driving to Burning Man.

8. **Be extra careful from Empire/Gerlach onwards**. Be on your best driving behaviour. Think “driving test to get your driving license for the first time”. Don’t give the cops any excuse to pull you over.

9. **Car lights** - you’ve got working car lights, both front and rear, right?

10. **Visible license plate**. Make sure there's absolutely nothing obstructing your license plates. It is illegal in Nevada to have something blocking the plates. If you have bike racks covering the plates, unscrew the plate and stick it on top of the bikes. Don't be an easy target for law enforcement.

11. **Have food and water**. Bring some food and water for the ride in. Don't forget napkins, spoons and garbage bag.

12. **Consider having a dashcam**. In case of a stop, you have hard evidence. Always have it on when you are inside the moving vehicle. A basic dashcam will set you back $50 bucks and can literally mean the difference between driving off scot free and lifelong court hassle.

13. [**Burner Express**](https://burnerexpress.burningman.org/) is the official Burning Man service that provides bus and air transit in and out. Both allow you to skip the line.

14. **Once you arrive to your camp** Make sure to **get the keys out of the car** as soon as possible upon arrival so you don't lock all your stuff in the car. Or just keep them with you at all times. Or keep that second copy of the keys attached to your utility belt. There are plenty of enterntaining stories on this topic.


## Exodus

A question that gets asked every year is "if I need to get to the airport in Reno/SF/LA by this time and day, when do I have to leave from playa?". And the answer is "nobody knows".

There is mainly one road that connects Black Rock City with the rest of the world: the 447, a double lane road (one lane per direction). Any event that may occur on that road may block it for hours (or days), and delay your trip back to the default world. Examples of things we have suffered through in the past:

* Traffic incidents: some times people drive too tired, or take unneccessary risks while driving, and when that happens local police may get involved to investigate the circumstances of the incident, leading to delays:`The crash happened Sunday, August 25, 2019 around 12:05PM on Washoe County Highway 34 north of Gerlach, and snarled Burning Man traffic for several hours.`
* Bush fires: in 2017 there was a bush fire along the 447, with the fire department working day and night to extinguish it. People trying to leave the event were stranded.
* Amber alerts: in 2016 a teenager (for all purposes, she was a minor) went missing during the night of burn: `Burning Man organizers closed the gates for several hours to search for a 17-year-old girl who had gone missing, creating a nine-hour wait for those seeking to leave the event.`
* Rain: traffic along the entire playa is halted when it rains. In 2014 a storm managed to delay the entrance to Burning Man up to 24h for some participants: `Black Rock City has shut down following rainstorms that left standing water on the playa, leaving it un-drivable.`

As you can see it is unpredictable. With that in mind:

1. **Give yourself an ample time buffer**. If you need to catch a plane, leave the playa at least 24h before that plane takes off. Set yourself up for a good decompression time in Reno, booking a night in a hotel where you can take a shower and rest. Any delay can most likely be absorbed by that 24h buffer, but keep in mind that you may end up missing that plane if things go south. If your flight leaves from San Francisco, perhaps you want to up that time buffer to 30h.
2. **Expect to stand in line**. There's no "good" time to leave. The shortest lines generally are either during the burn, right after, or sometime around 4am. However it is a gamble.
3. **Clean set of clothes**. Pack a clean set of clothes in a ziplock bag for the drive back and a clean face towel to wipe that stuff off your face.
4. **Have food and water**. Bring some food and water for the ride back. Don't forget napkins, spoons and garbage bag.
5. **Get some rest**. Make sure the driver(s) is rested. Falling asleep at the wheel happens every year on the drive home. Terrible way to end a great week at Burning Man. That’s like a designated driver.
6. **Police**. they will be looking for reasons to stop and search vehicles. Do not give them probable cause. Follow the same rules as described for Arrival.

Pro tip for cars: Bring an extra air filter for your vehicle. Keep it in a sealed bag. After you leave (in Gerlach, Empire, Nixon, or Fernley) replace your engine's filter. This will improve your gas mileage and protect your engine's health for the ride home.

## Drugs

I personally don't do, but they happen at Burning Man, so this section is included for education, safety and awareness.

1. **Don't take drugs from strangers**. This should be self explanatory, just don't. No matter how nice and well-wishing they appear. They might not know exactly what's inside, it could be too strong for you, there are a million ways this can go sideways.
2. **Don't give drugs to strangers**. If anyone asks if you have drugs - YOU DON'T. If a friend of yours told them "you might" - YOU STILL DON'T (then go yell at your friend for telling random people you may have drugs). Every year there are reports of undercover police dressed up like burners sniffing around for drugs.
3. **Again, don’t take drugs from strangers, don’t give drugs to strangers**. If anyone you don't know asks about drugs in any way shape of form - you don't know anything about drugs or anyone who may have any. But in case you have to deal with the police in any shape or form, read about [police interactions](https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/4wjfuk/how_to_deal_with_cops_at_burning_man_2016_update/).
4. **Be mindful about trying new drugs. Consider the risks**. If you don't know what a substance will do to you, and you are surrounded by people you just met, consider waiting until you get home to try it in a safe, controlled and comfortable environment with people you trust. You don’t want to end up having a bad trip all by yourself, because the people you were with left for the Diplo set at sunrise in the Robot Heart bus. You can also end up having a bad reaction to substances or whatever they may be cut with.
5. **Don't eye-ball substances that are typically measured in milligrams**. "Looks about right" can be 2-3 times a regular dose and can send you to a hospital in a best case scenario.
6. **Know your dose**. Many substances generally should be rationed according to user's body weight. A 90lbs girl needs way less MDMA than a 220lbs man to feel the same effect. Keep that in mind.
7. If you or somebody else is in the middle of a bad trip and would like support and help by trained personnel not associated with any agencies, go to [Zendo](http://www.zendoproject.org/). **In 2019 there were 2, located at 9 & C and 3 & C**. Generally look like this:  
    ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/S-ZtAK1GZXjvX8DJUTVsTCRQv4P780eQqb0NjGo96ysTa32zDbeyDAbFhJMatAQC1kSG5icwHqDOYq2B1tC3Ani__zwmJvd5-Jp1zrVv2Tm7QbHEueWciDA4FUQVFQW-jSjm4Gnl)![zendo-bm-2017-sticker-4inch-perk.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DuC_3EeJnTU2Qyt4dM0BwdJO18rm-gw2ePzfz30BQm98aBW9ZMhZvNqKjg27LedDdYP6YEr0OSX9aPab7N4EjjRRI1DbtDX1ukwjLEZZpIDyABSzo5U6nN4XVREbx3Zjug-TIXrr)
    > You can also ask for help to the Black Rock Rangers. They have some resources to help you in those situations, including a Zendo-like tent called “sanctuary” located near Center Camp. They will be able to call for transportation if the situation requires it.
8. **Keep drug related stuff out of the plain view**. DON'T have a bong standing in the open. DON'T do lines off your friend's ass, even if there's no wind at the moment. When it comes to substances, if you aren't inside a tent with closed doors or inside a closed porta potty, assume you are in the middle of a busy intersection downtown with cops everywhere. Use common sense, please. Being seen consuming drugs inside your or anyone else's camp can be a probable cause to search entire camp.
9. **Call a Black Rock Ranger or go to a medical station** if you or your friend is having a really bad time.
10. **Test your substances** using a reagent kit before getting to the playa.
11. **Best way to package your substances** for transit is to use vacuum sealer. Seal once, wash with rubbing alcohol, wash hands, seal again, wash the bag again.
12. **Avoid bringing large amounts for "friends"**. Don't let anyone shift liability on you. You don't want to get caught with large amounts, that's "[intent to distribute](https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/possession-with-the-intent-to-distribute.html)".
13. **Carry your MD recommendation**. Bring and carry prescriptions/notes for any controlled substance that’s **LEGAL** at a **federal level** that you are taking (read: Xanax, Adderall,..). 
	> Note that BRC is federal land, so as long as marijuana is illegal under federal laws, it is illegal in Burning Man. Your doctor’s note is worthless there.
14. There are some YouTube channels that are good resources on safety and education, like [DrugsLab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvRQKXtIGcK1yEnQ4Te8hWQ).
15. [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/) is THE source for education when it comes to all substances. Other places like [MAPS](https://maps.org/) are also a good resource.
16. [World Health Organization global Cocaine Project Study](https://wikileaks.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_global_Cocaine_Project_Study_suppressed_by_the_United_States_for_13_years,_1995) ([pdf](http://file.wikileaks.org/file/who-unicri-cocaine-project-study-1995.pdf), [TL;DR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t0r1IsodQWlsnp6HdjIEqNnUTIi0totWEE9wB3rX1Gg/edit?usp=sharing))
17. Naloxone (Narcan) has been approved in the USA as over-the-counter drug to help prevent an overdose with opiates. If you plan on taking some opiates (or something that might have opiates in it) bring naloxone (narcan). Tell your campmates where the naloxone is, and educate them on how to use it. Even if you don't plan to take, it is generally a good idea to bring some for your camp. It is inexpensive and can help prevent a serious surprise.

## Black Rock Rangers

As mentioned in the [How to deal with cops at Burning Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/4wjfuk/how_to_deal_with_cops_at_burning_man_2016_update/), if in trouble, look for a Black Rock Ranger. They are NOT police, and are there to help you. They are essentially participants with a working radio that have undergone through some very specific training to mediate, deescalate and generally help the Burning Man community as a whole.

They generally look something like this:
- They wear khaki/beige
- [Black Rock Ranger logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2695238084/4eb8936f4fa773fd61dcfaa2bf548cf8.png): looks like the BM logo with an embracing horseshoe-like trace, and the word “Ranger” at the bottom
